We will provide clear and comprehensive documentation for each data set, including metadata, methodologies, and any relevant contextual information. Transparency ensures the proper understanding and use of the data by the public.

### c. Collaboration

StarLab encourages collaboration and welcomes contributions from the public and the broader scientific community. By openly sharing data, we seek to foster partnerships that drive advancements in space exploration and related fields.

### d. License and Usage

Data sets released under this policy will be accompanied by a clear and permissive license that outlines the terms of use. StarLab may use widely accepted open licenses such as Creative Commons to specify usage permissions.

## 4. Data Release Process

### a. Data Identification

Before release, data sets will be identified based on their relevance, potential value, and appropriateness for public sharing.

### b. Documentation

Each data set will be thoroughly documented, including information on the source, collection methods, processing, and any limitations. Comprehensive documentation supports the usability and understanding of the data.
